# Automated Video Prediction and Visualization System

This repository provides an automated system for video prediction and visualization using PyTorch models for both prediction and feature extraction. Below is a description of the folder structure and key components.

## Folder Structure

### Checkpoint Folder
- **Description:** Contains the weights of the PyTorch model that have been trained using `main.py` and tested with `test.py` once the accuracy meets certain standards.
- **Usage:** The weights are moved to the `VIS/weight` folder for performing predictions and visualizations.

### UCF-Crime Folder
- **Description:** Contains the dataset with extracted features using both RGB and optical flow data.
- **Details:** A text file is included to list the names of the video files.

### Vis Folder
- **Purpose:** This folder is generally used to apply the pre-trained model for predicting and visualizing the target videos.
- **Contents:**
  - **NamaVideo.mp4:** For example, `Abuse001_x264.mp4` represents the raw video to be predicted.
  - **NamaVideo Folder:** Contains frames extracted from `NamaVideo.mp4` using `ffmpeg`.
  - **models Folder:** Contains the model architecture used for feature extraction.
  - **PNG Folder:** Contains the prediction plots generated by the model.
  - **RE Folder:** Contains individual frames with prediction results.
  - **weight Folder:** Contains the prediction model weights (`ckpt.pth`) and the feature extraction model weights.
  - **NamaVideo_result.mp4:** Contains the final prediction video, which is a combination of frames with prediction results.
  - **learner File:** Defines the architecture of the prediction model.
  - **video2frame File:** Converts a video into frames.
  - **vis File:** Performs both prediction and visualization.

### Root Folder
- **dataset File:** Contains the code for the dataset loader object.
- **FFC File:** The second version of the learner, intended
